# From Punycode String (IDNA) to ASCII
$: echo -n 'https://—Ä–∞—É—Ä–∞l.—Å–æm/l–ægin' | idn -a

# From Punycode String (IDNA/ASCII) to Unicode

https://—Ä–∞—É—Ä–∞l.—Å–æm/l–ægin

# When DNS try to resolve the host (Punycode String)

# ü§∫ Utility in Social Engineering

> "Punycode is a way to represent Unicode with the limited character subset of ASCII supported by the Domain Name System (DNS)".

Therefore this tool can be used for Social Engineering Attacks in the following scenarios:

- Email Spoofing: Crafting email addresses that closely mimic those of trusted individuals or organizations using Punycode.

- Fake Website Creation: Register domain names containing Punycode characters to replicate well-known websites.

- Social Media Impersonation: Creation of Social Media profiles that impersonate genuine individuals or organizations.

- Phishing campaigns: Generate phishing links with Punycode-encoded domain names so that victim click on seemingly authentic links.
